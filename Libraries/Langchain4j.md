# LangChain4j
LangChain4j is a Java-first framework for developing applications powered by large language models. Inspired by the popular LangChain Python library, it provides a modular, strongly typed, and idiomatic Java API for integrating LLMs into real-world systems. It supports prompt templating, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory, tool and function calling, and multi-step workflows. LangChain4j simplifies the process of building intelligent assistants, AI-enhanced developer tools, and semantic search experiences within the Java ecosystem.

The framework integrates with major LLM providers such as OpenAI, Hugging Face, Mistral, Ollama, and Voyage AI. It also includes built-in support for multiple vector stores like MongoDB. As of version 1.0.1, it has reached a stable release and continues to evolve rapidly with an engaged community on GitHub and Discord. LangChain4j works well with or without Spring Boot and is compatible with Java 17 and above.

In practice, I set up a local RAG service using Ollama and a custom Markdown document loader. I used the `langchain4j-mongodb-atlas` integration for semantic search, tested streaming chat completion and function calling with OpenAI, and composed a multi-component assistant using the chain pattern.

The framework's strengths include its clean Java design, strong type safety, and modular architecture. It's easy to integrate into existing Spring apps or plain Java services, and it provides solid abstractions for combining retrievers, memory, and chat models. It supports both cloud and local models effectively.

On the downside, documentation is still improving and spread across multiple repositories and examples. There is some initial setup friction, especially for developers new to the LLM ecosystem. Compared to LangChain for Python, the ecosystem is newer and has fewer working examples.

LangChain4j is well-suited for building internal assistants, semantic search APIs, developer-focused CLI tools, and educational demos. Its core modules are stable and maturing, with most workflows functioning reliably as of version 1.0.1.

Overall, itâ€™s highly useful for Java teams looking to adopt AI features without leaving the Java ecosystem. The maintainers are active and the Java LLM space is growing, with LangChain4j leading the way.
