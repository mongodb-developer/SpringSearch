# Vaadin Flow (Java)
Vaadin Flow offers a server-side Java API for building web UIs without writing front-end code. It uses Web Components under the hood and abstracts client-server communication via WebSocket/JSON :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

### What I Tried
- Created a simple data-entry app with forms and grids
- Leveraged auto-binding of backend state to UI components

### Strengths
- No need for HTML/JavaScript for UIs
- Tight integration with Spring Boot
- Secure by running UI logic on the server

### Weaknesses
- Less flexible UI design compared to SPA frameworks
- Potential performance concerns with high-traffic UIs

### Status
- Stability: Robust server-side UI framework
- Utility: Great for enterprise tools, dashboards, internal apps
- Community: Mature and supported by Vaadin Ltd.
