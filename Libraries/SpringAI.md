# Spring AI
Spring AI is a framework that integrates AI capabilities like large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into the Spring ecosystem. It offers a consistent and idiomatic way for Java developers to build intelligent applications with minimal friction.

The framework abstracts away the complexity of working with providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, Mistral, and Ollama. It provides pluggable interfaces for chat models, embedding models, vector stores, and document retrievers — all configurable using Spring Boot conventions.

### What I Tried

- Integrated OpenAI GPT-4 as a chat model with streaming responses  
- Used local Ollama model with the `ollama` starter for LLM and embedding  
- Configured MongoDB Atlas Vector Search as the vector store  use the [[SpringAI API]]
- Created a simple RAG-based QA API with `@RestController`  
- Used `PromptTemplate` and `MessageChatModel` for system-role chat composition  

### Strengths

- Fits naturally into existing Spring Boot projects  
- Pluggable backend providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Hugging Face, etc.)  
- Seamless integration with Spring config, logging, and observability  
- Good support for both chat and embedding use cases  

### Weaknesses

- Some abstractions feel opinionated or still evolving  
- Not all features documented or consistent across providers  
- Limited support for fine-grained control over model parameters  

### Status

- Stability: Version 1.0.0 released May 2025  
- Utility: Excellent for rapid prototyping and production RAG systems  
- Community: Backed by Spring team with growing GitHub presence  

Spring AI is ideal for Java developers looking to build AI features such as semantic search, AI-powered chat, or agent-like workflows using familiar Spring idioms. With the introduction of the 1.0 release, it’s now ready for broader adoption in enterprise and hobby projects alike.
