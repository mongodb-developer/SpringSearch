# Quarkus
Quarkus is purpose-built for cloud-native and serverless environments. It supports JVM and GraalVM native compilation, offers ultra-fast startup, live coding, and Dev UI â€” making Java feel modern again.

### What I Tried
- Built a REST API with reactive endpoints using Mutiny
- Generated a native binary via GraalVM
- Used Dev UI and continuous testing in dev mode

### Strengths
- Blazing fast startup and low memory footprint
- Developer-friendly live coding experience
- Cloud-first architecture out of the box

### Weaknesses
- Requires GraalVM for native builds (adds complexity)
- Smaller ecosystem than Spring Boot, though growing

### Status
- Stability: Homed in on production readiness (v3.24.1 as of June 2025)
- Utility: Excellent for microservices and FaaS
- Community: Vibrant, with strong enterprise backing
