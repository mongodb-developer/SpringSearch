# Actix Web
Actix Web is a mature, high-performance Rust web framework built on Actix actor system. It prioritizes speed and robustness, ideal for high-concurrency backend services :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

### What I Tried
- Built REST endpoints with JSON serialization
- Used middleware for request logging and error handling
- Stress-tested concurrency performance

### Strengths
- Exceptional throughput and low latency
- Strong type safety and memory assurance
- Rich ecosystem of middleware and extensions

### Weaknesses
- Steep learning curve for Rust beginners
- Actor model introduces complexity for small apps

### Status
- Stability: Production-ready and widely adopted
- Utility: Perfect for high-performance APIs and microservices
- Community: Active with regular contributions
